# **Go Cli Checklist**
--- 

Welcome to Go CLI Checklist, this is a CLI / Tui based Task manager. Everything is stored locally so there's no need to be online or fear forgetting your password.

## **Basic Setup**


The CSV is stored on your user directory if you ever need to locate it.

i.e

`C:\Users\Lenovo\checklists.csv` 

## **Advanced Shortcuts**


Use these flags

    - checklist -create a
    - checklist -read a
    - checklist -update a
    - checklist -delete a

they skip the intial question. [^1]

[^1]: Maybe some scerets ones to be added later.

## **Future Updates**
